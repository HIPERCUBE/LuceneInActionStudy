## Document

**Document** represents a collection of fields.

Fields of a document represent the document or meta-data associated with that document.

The original source(such as a database record, a Microsoft Word document, a chapter from a book etc) of document data is irrelevant to Lucene.

The meta-data such as author, title, subject, date modified, and so on, are indexed and stored separately as fields of a document.

**Document** contains more than one [Field](https://github.com/HIPERCUBE/LuceneInActionStudy/tree/master/book/CoreIndexingClasses/Field.md) object which has target text to index.
